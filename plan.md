# Project Plan

## Phase 1: UI Enhancements for Financial Statement Analysis

### 1.1. Input Form Realignment

-   **Goal:** Position the stock ticker input field and the "Fetch Financial Data" button on the same line for a more compact and user-friendly layout, as requested in the screenshot.
-   **File to Modify:** `src/FinancialStatement.jsx`
-   **Implementation Details:**
    -   Wrap the input field and the button in a single container element (e.g., a `div`).
    -   Apply CSS Flexbox or Grid properties to the container to align the items horizontally.
    -   Ensure proper spacing and alignment between the label, input field, and button.
-   **File to Modify for styles:** `src/App.css`

### 1.2. Tooltip Replacement

-   **Goal:** Replace the existing CSS-based tooltips for the financial metrics with a more integrated and readable hover-to-reveal description.
-   **File to Modify:** `src/FinancialStatement.jsx`
-   **Implementation Details:**
    -   Remove the current `div` with the `group` and `group-hover` classes that implements the tooltip.
    -   Implement a state-based solution (e.g., using the `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` events on the metric card) to toggle the visibility of the description.
    -   The description text should appear smoothly below the metric title when the user hovers over the card.
-   **File to Modify for styles:** `src/App.css`

### 1.3. Input Form Alignment Fix

-   **Goal:** Correct the vertical alignment of the stock ticker input field and the "Fetch Financial Data" button to ensure they appear neatly on the same line, with the label positioned correctly above them.
-   **File to Modify:** `src/FinancialStatement.jsx`
-   **File to Modify for styles:** `src/App.css`
-   **Implementation Details:**
    -   Adjust the flexbox properties in `App.css` for the `.input-form-container` to control the vertical alignment of its children (e.g., using `align-items: flex-end`).
    -   Ensure the `label` and `input` elements are structured in a way that allows for clean alignment with the adjacent button.

## Phase 2: Code Refinements and Future Features

-   [ ] Refactor Python scripts for better error handling and modularity.
-   [ ] Add more financial metrics to the analysis.
-   [ ] Implement charting for historical stock data.
-   [ ] Add unit and integration tests for the components and API calls.
